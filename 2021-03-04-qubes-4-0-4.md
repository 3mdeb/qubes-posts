We're pleased to announce the release of Qubes OS 4.0.4! This is the
fourth stable release of Qubes 4.0. It includes many updates over the
initial 4.0 release, including:

- All 4.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 32 TemplateVM
- Debian 10 TemplateVM
- Whonix 15 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 5.4 by default

Qubes 4.0.4 is available on the [downloads] page.


What is a patch release?
------------------------

A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and [fully updating][update] it results in the same system as
installing Qubes 4.0.4.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you installed Qubes 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, or 4.0.3 and have [fully
updated][update], then your system is already equivalent to a Qubes
4.0.4 installation. No further action is required.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.4 ISO makes this more convenient
and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date. Please see
the [installation guide] for detailed instructions.

Thank you to all the release candidate users for testing this release
and [reporting issues][reporting-bugs]!
