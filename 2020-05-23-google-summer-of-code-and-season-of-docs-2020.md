We're pleased to announce that the Qubes OS Project will be
participating in both [Google Summer of Code] and [Google Season of
Docs] for 2020!

For Google Summer of Code this year, William Huang will be working on
[Template Manager and Package Handling Improvements] under the
mentorship of Qubes project lead [Marek Marczykowski-Górecki].
Specifically, William will be "designing a better mechanism for handling
template installation and creating a user-facing application to deal
with such mechanism and other template-related configuration,
consolidating the management of templates." For more information about
Google Summer of Code in relation to the Qubes OS project, please see
our [information page][gsoc].

Meanwhile, with Google Season of Docs, we're still in the [technical
writer exploration phase], in which "interested technical writers
discuss project ideas with mentoring organizations." If you're
interested in [participating in Google Season of Docs with Qubes][gsod],
the technical writer application period begins on June 9, 2020 at 18:00
UTC, and the deadline is July 9, 2020 at 18:00 UTC.
