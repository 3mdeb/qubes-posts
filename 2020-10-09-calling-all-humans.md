Greetings, Qubes community! We are running our first ever survey of current, former, and future Qubes OS users. We invite you all to lend us 10-15min of your time, to participate. 

<https://survey.qubes-os.org/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=791682&lang=en>

The Qubes OS team loves the conversations we have with our community across forums, email lists, in support tickets, and at conferences. As most of us understand, though, structured data is very different --- and clear information to help us make product and development decisions in the weeks and months to come, we feel is necessary to best serve our users. 

This survey is also just the beginning of several weeks of user research work that will consist of interviews, user testing, co-creation workshop(s) with users guided by a ux specialist, and possibly more surveys. At the end of this survey, weâ€™ll collect contact information should participating in that work be of interest to folks. We also look forward to keeping folks updated in our user communities, with how all of this work is progressing.
