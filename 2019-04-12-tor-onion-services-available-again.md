We previously announced that the [Qubes Tor onion services were no
longer being maintained][orig-onion-ann] due to lack of resources.
However, [Unman] generously agreed to bring them back, and they're now
available once again!

Here are the new onion service URLs:

```
Website:   www.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion
Yum repo:  yum.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion
Deb repo:  deb.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion
ISOs:      iso.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion
```

Soon, you will be able to get the new, correct repo definitions just by
updating dom0 and your TemplateVMs. However, if you can't wait, please
follow these step-by-step instructions on the Whonix wiki:
