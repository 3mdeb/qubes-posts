We regret to announce that the Qubes Tor onion services will no longer
be maintained due to lack of resources. This includes all Qubes onion
services, including the Qubes website onion mirror and the onion package
repos.

We would like to thank the Whonix Project for generously maintaining
these services [for over a year][orig-onion-ann]. Maintaining the Tor
onion services requires labor, servers, and bandwidth. Unfortunately,
none of these resources are available to the Qubes OS or Whonix projects
in sufficient quantities to allow us to continue offering these
services.

We recommend that users who currently rely on any Qubes onion addresses
transition to the corresponding clearnet addresses immediately.
