As a reminder following our previous [announcement], Fedora 34 has now
reached EOL ([end-of-life]). If you have not already done so, we
strongly recommend [upgrading] all remaining Fedora 34 templates and
standalones to Fedora 35 immediately.

We provide fresh Fedora 35 template packages through the official Qubes
repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard
[installation instructions]. Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step
instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade] of an existing Fedora
template. After upgrading your templates, please remember to [switch all
qubes that were using the old template to use the new one][switching].

For a complete list of template releases that are supported for your
specific Qubes release, see our [supported template releases].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL].
