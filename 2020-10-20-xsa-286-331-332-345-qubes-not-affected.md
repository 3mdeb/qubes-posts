The Xen Project has published the following Xen Security Advisories:
XSA-286, XSA-331, XSA-332, and XSA-345. These XSAs do **not** affect the
security of Qubes OS, and no user action is necessary.

**Special note:** Although XSA-345 is included in [QSB #060], we do not
consider XSA-345 to affect the security of Qubes OS, since the default
configuration is safe, and we have already implemented appropriate
safeguards to prevent users from changing to a vulnerable configuration
by accident. Please see the Impact section of [QSB #060] for further
details.

These XSAs have been added to the [XSA Tracker]:
