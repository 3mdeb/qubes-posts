Qubes OS releases are normally [supported] for six months after each
subsequent [major or minor release]. However, in light of the more
demanding [system requirements] of Qubes 4.0, we previously announced
that we were [extending] the support period for Qubes 3.2 to one full
year after the release of Qubes 4.0. Since Qubes 4.0 was [released] on
2018-03-28, support for Qubes 3.2 is [extended until 2019-03-28].

Therefore, we strongly urge all current Qubes 3.2 users to [upgrade to
Qubes 4.0] before Qubes 3.2 reaches end-of-life (EOL) on 2019-03-28.
As always, the latest release is available on the [downloads] page.
