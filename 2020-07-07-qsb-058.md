          Insufficient cache write-back under VT-d (XSA-321)


Summary
========

On 2020-07-07, the Xen Security Team published Xen Security Advisory
321 (CVE-2020-15565 / XSA-321) [1] with the following description:

| When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them
| require flushing of both TLBs.  Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent,
| and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs CPU cached also needs writing
| back to memory after changes were made.  Such writing back of cached
| data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into
| smaller granularity ones.
| 
| A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to
| frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another
| purpose.  Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege
| escalation cannot be ruled out.

A malicious HVM qube with a PCI device (such as sys-net or sys-usb in
Qubes' default configuration) can potentially compromise the whole
system.

Only Intel systems are affected. AMD systems are not affected.


Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes 4.0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.5-19

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qube Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

A system restart will be required afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
