The Season of Docs program has [announced] the technical writing projects chosen for 2019.
We are pleased to congratulate [Lukas à Porta (aka luzeal)] on the selection of his project: [Onboard with Qubes OS!]

We received many excellent proposals from talented writers.
Unfortunately, we had to choose just a single one, and this decision was extremely difficult.
Regardless of whether you applied or your proposal was accepted, we invite you to [collaborate on the Qubes documentation].
The documentation is primarily a community effort, and it only gets better when you get involved!
