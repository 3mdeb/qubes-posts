The Qubes OS Project is seeking an expert in automated testing. We use
OpenQA and Travis to test changes to the Qubes OS source code and
automated building from source. We're looking for someone who can help
with improving both the automated tests themselves and the testing
infrastructure.

This is a paid position on a three-month part-time contract through the
Internews BASICS project (Building Analytical and Support Infrastructure
for Critical Security tools):
