Our journey towards automating OS tests on physical laptops started few years ago with an idea to use Intel AMT to drive tests on a physical machine. At the start, I got some [initial implementation](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/pull/983) working: in particular, VNC for input/output and power control worked. I tried to get a virtual CD working, but it turned out to be quite unstable. Worse and more importantly - it was really just a CD, not a CD/DVD - which meant that the protocol couldn't handle images larger than 2GB.
Some time later I abandoned this approach, for two related reasons:
 - many machines that Qubes OS wants to support intentionally do not have Intel AMT
 - a single AMT-enabled machine, which I used for developing this feature, broke

If anyone would like to resume this work, [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200926070850/senseless.info/amt.html) includes _a lot_ of useful info about Intel AMT on Linux.

Recently I came back to the project with a new approach: to capture video from HDMI output and use emulated USB keyboard/mouse for input. Then, I added power control to the mix, combined everything on a Raspberry PI and got a [working prototype](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/pull/1741) of an openQA worker that runs the tests on a physical machine, instead of a virtual one.

The whole setup includes several devices:
 - one "central" Raspberry Pi that controls a power strip and serves boot files
 - one Raspberry Pi per laptop that runs an openQA worker for that laptop; it emulates a USB device for that laptop and captures HDMI output from it

All those elements are detailed below.

## Base system

The goal was to run an openQA worker on a Raspberry PI 4. Why a Raspberry Pi?
 - the USB controller can play a device role, not only USB host
 - it is powerful enough to run video processing required by openQA
 - it is (mostly) readily available and relatively cheep

As a base system I've chosen OpenSUSE, because that's openQA's native distribution. Getting OpenSUSE to work on RPi was [rather straightforward](https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi4), but the choice does lead to few issues mentioned later in this article.

## Power control

Power control was the first stage of this project - I thought it looked like the simplest part.

To reliably run unattended tests, I needed a way to interrupt a test when it went into some not recoverable state (including kernel panic, hard hang etc). With AMT I had a built-in API for that, but now I needed something else. I chose a remotely controlled (via USB) power strip. Then, I removed batteries from laptops connected to the setup. This gave me a very reliable way to interrupt whatever was running on the machine by simply powering it down. But it turned out powering it back on may not be that simple.

In the current setup there are several laptops, each of them slightly different, and each (sic!) requiring a bit different approach to power management. The things I tried and that worked on some machines:
1. Setting BIOS to automatically power on the machine when power supply is connected. This is the simplest method. Sadly, only one of the machines supports it.
2. Sending a Wake-On-Lan packet. Here, reliability depends on device - for some it just works, others require enabling it in the network card (`ethtool -s eth0 wol g` command). And some lose the setting either on system startup, or on disconnecting the power...
3. When everything else fails, one can just press the physical power button. Of course it would be too much work to do it manually, so, I attached a servo motor in the exact spot where the power button is. Then, I drive that servo motor from RPi.

## System startup

After achieving control over system power, the next step was taking control of what operating system starts there. I have considered two options:
 - USB boot drive, emulated from RPi
 - network boot

The first option turned to be problematic when connected with emulated USB input devices (see below), at least on some laptops. While a single USB device can have multiple interfaces (basically being sub-devices), many system firmware do not like to boot from it. When I exposed a USB device that has both a storage interface and an HID interface (keyboard/mouse), the system didn't considered it a bootable device. A solution would be to use two separate devices, but that would require yet another RPi (or similar), since most (all?) of such boards support emulating only a single device. Another way around it could be emulating a USB hub and getting two virtual devices this way, but Linux does not support USB hub emulation. Since I did have an alternative, I have not explored this option any further. On systems that are fine with a single multi-function USB device, I can use that, on others - I use network boot.

The second option turned out not that straightforward either. First of all, not all systems support booting from the network in the first place. To solve this problem, I've got a USB stick and put [iPXE](https://ipxe.org) on it. Then I configured the system to boot from that USB. I couldn't use Grub here to gain network boot, because Grub supports only network devices via the system firmware (BIOS/EFI) support - and this support is missing on systems not capable of network booting. iPXE, on the other hand, supports a wide range of network devices on its own, and also allows simple scripting - like booting different systems depending on various settings. Unfortunately, it cannot boot Xen via multiboot2 protocol (required to boot with full EFI support), it can only do multiboot1. So, I did need Grub. Luckily, iPXE does register its drivers as appropriate EFI services, so when I load Grub from iPXE, it can talk to the network.

I prepared a Grub configuration that can boot different systems on different laptops depending on a separate configuration file (loaded via `load_env` grub's command) and a tool to conveniently switch between them. This got me a nice menu:

    $ testbed-control 2 help
    Selected target: 2

    Available commands:
     - reset - hard reset the target
     - poweron - power on the target
     - poweroff - (hard) power off the target
     - wake - wake up the system (either wake-on-lan, or button press)
     - rescue - switch next boot to rescue system (doesn't load anything from the disk)
     - fallback - switch next boot to fallback system (loads /boot/efi/EFI/qubes/grub-fallback.cfg)
     - normal - switch next boot to normal system
     - custom - switch next boot to custom grub config (/srv/tftp/test2/grub.cfg)

The first four commands are about power control (see earlier), the rest are about choosing what to boot. The `normal` command simply starts the system installed on the local disk, `rescue` allows to boot initramfs-only system to diagnose why the normal system doesn't work, while `custom` option allows, in practice, starting an arbitrary kernel (not necessarily from the disk). That option is especially useful for debugging Linux or Xen issues, including doing automatic bisection, although it requires a bit more glue scripts (that's a topic for another article).

Surprisingly, I've got one case where booting local system turned out to be tricky. When the bootloader is loaded from the network, that particular UEFI does not register services to access the local disk. And as it turns out, Grub does not support NVMe drives directly - it does that only via UEFI services. I could have switched here to another disk, or to booting via USB, but neither of those options felt appealing. I did want to run tests on NVMe drives too, and while USB booting works, it is a bit fragile, because one needs to be careful to not overwrite that boot drive (especially when testing system installation). So, I have developed a workaround: setting a `BootNext` EFI variable (selecting alternative boot option just for the next startup) and rebooting. Unfortunately Grub itself does not have a function to set EFI variables (it can only read them), but building Linux + minimal initrd with relevant tools is rather easy. By the way, if I was starting Linux anyway, I could simply kexec the target kernel from the NVMe disk using Linux's drivers, but I wanted the actual startup to remain closer to the "normal" startup - including respecting relevant grub configuration.

There was one final problem to solve: when installing Qubes OS, it will set itself as the default boot target. This means, any of the above boot options will be overriden by the installer. To solve this issue, I passed to the installer a kickstart file that restores original boot order at the very final step (`%post` script).

So, to summarize, I have now:
 - a way to load Grub2 on each test system (either via PXE, or via iPXE loaded from USB stick)
 - a way to conveniently control what Grub2 will start
 - a way to load a local kernel even if Grub2 does not sees the disk

## Video capture

I started experimenting with HDMI-over-IP extenders. Some turned out to use a rather [standard video format](https://blog.danman.eu/new-version-of-lenkeng-hdmi-over-ip-extender-lkv373a/) for streaming. It worked fine... with one little inconvenience: handling the network stream put a significant load on the Raspberry PI that handled it. I could use a different system for video processing than the RPi responsible for USB emulation, but that would make the whole setup even more complex. Anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience that requires some more cooling on the RPi, not a deal breaker.

About the time I got all of this working, I came across [PiKVM](https://pikvm.org), which looked almost exactly like what I needed. It uses TC358743 chip connected directly to a RPi (via camera interface) instead of a separate HDMI-to-IP encoder. Setting it up had some challenges, but the PiKVM project (or, should I say, Maxim Davaev - the guy behind the project) had all of this figured out already.

The first issue I encountered is getting a TC358743 device initialized and detected at all. There are several parts to that:
1. The default kernel from OpenSUSE does not include necessary drivers (especially `bcm2835-unicam`). Those are currently available only in a [kernel from Raspberry foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#v4l2). I chose to compile it myself, with a config based on the one from PiKVM project. There could be something I'm missing here, but this approach got me a working setup and I didn't want to spend too much time on debugging video drivers.
2. Several modifications to the `config.txt` are required:
  - `dtoverlay=tc358743` - let the kernel know where the device is
  - `start_x=1` - load GPU firmware with video input processing included
  - `gpu_mem=128` - required by `start_x=1`
  The latter two must be in `config.txt` specifically, not a file [included](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html#include) from there - which is a bit problematic on OpenSUSE, because the `config.txt` is forcefully overridden on each update and only (included) `extraconfig.txt` is meant for user modification. I worked around the issue by mounting bootloader partition under an alternative mountpoint, to disarm `config.txt` override. This issue is [tracked in OpenSUSE bugzilla](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1192047). I have yet to test the upstream fix for the issue.

After fixing the above, I've got `/dev/video0` device. Then it was just a matter of [configuring it](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=281972). Specifically:
1. Loading appropriate EDID: `v4l2-ctl --set-edid=...`. The EDID describes capabilities of this "monitor". There is a catch if you want to use Full HD resolution: the interface bandwidth is a bit too low for 1920x1080 with 60Hz refresh rate, but it is enough for 50Hz (yes, unfortunately). This had to be described in the EDID. The author of the above linked tutorial [provided some examples](https://github.com/6by9/CSI2_device_config).
2. Setting digital video timings: `v4l2-ctl --set-dv-bt-timings query`. This can be done only when the system connected to the HDMI port starts and chooses a resolution - and it needs to be repeated each time the resolution changes. 

I've [integrated](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/pull/1741) both of the above into the openQA driver.

For the openQA integration, using 1920x1080 resolution was not perfect. openQA operates on images 1024x768. If it receives anything else, it scales it. The result of 1920x1080 screen capture downscaled to 1024x768 was not nice, to say it mildly. It not only made some text unreadable, but the difference in the aspect ratio heavily distorted the image. This, for example, made it impossible to re-use reference images made in other tests. I am considering enhancing openQA to support other resolutions too, but for now I have set the resolution on the tested system to 1024x768 (and used an EDID that lists that resolution).

[![Scalled down screenshot](/attachment/posts/openqa-hw-screen-scaled.png)](/attachment/posts/openqa-hw-screen-scaled.png)

On the tested system, something needs to actually enable HDMI output. For this purpose, I pass a kickstart file to the Qubes OS installer that includes commands to execute before installation (`%pre` section). While at it, I can use the same kickstart file for other test-related customizations, like restoring default boot order at the end or enabling SSH access for collecting logs.

## HID input

Recording video output is not everything. To run tests, one needs to also send commands to the system under test (SUT). This can be done by several methods, including serial console and SSH connection. In order to have the most realistic setup, I've chosen to emulate USB input devices. With this, we could interact with the system in the same way a user would. To emulate USB input device(s) I use Linux USB Gadget subsystem. To emulate HID devices, I need to prepare an HID descriptor - a description for the driver, listing what kind of device it is and what events it can send.

I wanted the device(s) to meet the following requirements:
 - have two interfaces (which in practice is two separate HID devices): keyboard and pointer (mouse/tablet)
 - be properly categorized by udev (so [input proxy](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-input-proxy) properly picks it up)
 - be properly categorized by Xorg
 - support both absolute pointer position events (like "move mouse to a specific point" instead of "move mouse a bit to the right"), and normal mouse buttons

I've searched for a descriptor meeting the above requirements. The one for keyboard is a rather standard one, but the one for mouse/tablet device is not. So, I took [Device Class Definition for HID 1.11 together with HID Usage Tables 1.22](https://www.usb.org/hid) and crafted one myself. This was a bit of a challenge, because both udev and Xorg have a set of heuristics to categorize devices, and they differ in subtle ways.

Then, I've written a [script](https://gist.github.com/marmarek/5c44ffeb2f36e106b4d34e7e8780c208) that sets this all up and controls the device(s) according to what openQA requests.

The last detail is about connecting RPi to the target system. RPi4 has a single USB-C port used both for powering the RPi itself, as well as the USB device emulation. Generally this would be fine, with an exception that the target system is going to be disconnected from the power from time to time. If RPi would be powered this way, it would loose the power too, and there would be nothing capable of turning it back on. This is yet another case where PiKVM project comes with an [inspiration](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm#setting-up-the-v2) - Y-split cable that connects VBUS pin only to one end and the data pins to the other.

## Serial console

Several openQA functions require some kind of console access. This includes retrieving commands output (and exit code), waiting for various events etc. But unfortunately, a real serial console is very rare in modern laptops. I could restructure the tests to not use those functions, but that would be rather disappointing on the tests results quality side. As a solution I've added a small qrexec service in dom0 that reads a pipe that pretends to be a serial console; then I've used `qvm-connect-tcp` in `sys-net` to redirect TCP port to that service. This isn't as reliable as a real serial console (especially for things like restarting `sys-net`), but it does work in majority of cases. In a few rare cases that does not work - in the future, I will restructure the tests to not rely on this functionality.

## Bonus: remotely controlled test laptops for developers

The remote power and boot control is useful not only for automatic tests, but also for ordinary developers. There are several cases it is useful:
 - additional machine to develop/test features on a different Qubes version
 - access to a specific hardware

I've prepared the whole setup to be usable not only with openQA, but also to allow delegation of specific test machines to individual trusted developers. More importantly, this allows not only manually testing software on those machines, but all this extra infrastructure allows automating several tasks, such as git bisect mentioned earlier.

## Final thoughts

Testing a whole operating system is a challenging task, because there are a lot of moving parts. openQA is a great tool for that, but its main target is running tests in a virtualized environment. This works fine for several components (like Qubes Manager, or GUI virtualization), but not for hardware-related features (sys-net, sys-usb, system suspend, and several more). Before this work, we have ran tests on actual laptops manually, but that was time consuming and thus not all the updates or configurations were tested. Having test automation allows this to be much more comprehensive, including ensuring harware compatibility for the Qubes OS certified hardware.
